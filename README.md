Embark on an enriching journey through the world of SQL with our comprehensive series. We'll kickstart our exploration by delving into the foundational aspects of DDL, DML, and DQL commands, unraveling their diverse applications and significance.
As we progress, we'll delve into more advanced topics, including stored procedures, window functions, and various types of joins, offering a deeper understanding of their functionalities and practical implications. 
Finally, we'll round off our journey by delving into set operators and subqueries, completing our toolkit for proficient data manipulation and analysis.

Topics: 
1. DDL (Data Definition Language):
   - "CREATE": Establish new database objects.
   - "ALTER": Modify existing database structures.
   - "DELETE": Remove specific data records.
   - "TRUNCATE": Efficiently clear entire tables.

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language) and DQL (Data Query Language):
   - These commands focus on manipulating and querying data within the database.

3. Stored Procedures, Window Functions, and Joins:
   - Stored Procedures: Encapsulate frequently used tasks for reusability.
   - Window Functions: Perform analytical tasks on specific sets of rows.
   - Joins: Merge data from multiple tables based on specified criteria.

4. Advanced Joins:
   - Expanding on basic joins, advanced join operations offer more intricate data merging capabilities.

5. Set Operators and Subqueries:
   - Set Operators: Combine and compare result sets from multiple queries.
   - Subqueries: Perform operations within other queries, enhancing data retrieval and manipulation.
